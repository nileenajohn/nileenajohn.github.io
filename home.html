      <h1 class="heading-text">About</h1>
      <p class="body-text">I am a 2nd year student studying Computer Science at Northeastern University.</p>
      <h5><b>Computer Science Background</b></h5>
      <p class="body-text"> I have been interested in Computer Science since high school, where I took my first CS class, AP Computer Science Principles. Since then, I have continued to take CS courses in High School from AP Computer Science A to Advanced Data Structures. Now being in college, I have learned so many new skills as I have been studying to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Northeastern University. Throughout my computer science career, I have learned JavaScript, Java, HTML & CSS, and Python. I continue to use these skills and explore others in my classes at Northeastern and computer science initiatives outside of the classroom.</p>
