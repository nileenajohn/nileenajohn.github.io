          Hi! My name is Nileena and I work as an Engineer I at Verizon. I am currently a part of Verizon's Leadership Development Program under the Enterprise Architecture track. I recently graduated from Northeastern University with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
          
          I am interested in a wide array of topics surrounding computing, with a primary focus on Software Development and Artificial Intelligence. At Verizon, I have developed applications, presented my work to leadership, and built meaningful connections.

          In my personal time, I enjoy playing tennis, dancing, and watching fashion shows. This website serves as a portfolio of the work I have done throughout my academic, professional, and personal careers. Feel free to explore my projects and learn more about how I turn my passions into meaningful work!
